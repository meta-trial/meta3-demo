META3 Demo Project
==================

This is a demo project of the EDC used by the META3_ clinical trial.

This demo sets up the META3 EDC to run on a Django_ test server_ in DEBUG_ mode on your local machine.

These are NOT the installation steps for a production system.

Installation
------------

You'll need to install ``mysql`` and ``miniconda`` on your local machine.

Get miniconda here
    https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html


Now that ``mysql`` and ``miniconda`` are install on your local machine, let's get started.

First, create the demo database

.. code-block:: bash

  mysql -Bse 'create database meta3_demo character set utf8;'


Create a project folder and clone the repo into it

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir ~/clinicedc && \
  cd ~/clinicedc && \
  git clone https://github.com/meta-trial/meta3-demo.git


Create a ``conda`` environment named ``meta3_demo`` and activate it

.. code-block:: bash

  conda create -n meta3_demo python=3.10 && \
  conda activate meta3_demo


With the ``conda`` environment activated, install the ``meta-edc`` python package

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install meta-edc==0.2.33


Now that the application is installed, we need to make some changes to the configuration. 

Copy the sample environment file to a working copy

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/clinicedc/meta3-demo && cp .env-sample .env


Note
    Sensitive config values are stored in the environment by using an ``.env`` file and ``environ``. (see also see https://12factor.net)

Next, edit your working copy of the environment file (.env). Look for ``DATABASE_URL`` at the top of the file. Change the value for ``DATABASE_URL`` to include your mysql user and password. The mysql account will need root or root-like permissions. Since this is a test server running locally, just use ``root``.

.. code-block:: bash

  # find this line
  DATABASE_URL=mysql://<username>:<password>@127.0.0.1:3306/meta3_demo
  
  # and change with your details, for example
  DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:dumela@127.0.0.1:3306/meta3_demo

Next we need to create the keys used for data encryption. 

Run ``manage.py`` check_ for the first time. This will ask django-crypto-fields_ to create encryption keys.

.. code-block:: bash

  python manage.py check

Note
    The system encrypts sensitive data (personally identifiable information or PII) using django-crypto-fields_. The first time you run
    ``manage.py``, django-crypto-fields_ looks for the keys. If they do not exist, it creates them. 


Now go back and edit the working copy of your environment file ``.env``. 


Change ``DJANGO_AUTO_CREATE_KEYS`` to False

.. code-block:: bash

    DJANGO_AUTO_CREATE_KEYS=False

Run manage.py check_ again. 

.. code-block:: bash

  python manage.py check


You should see a final message ``System check identified 3 issues (1 silenced)``. Since this is a test server, you may ignore these warnings.  


Now you are ready to prepare the database that you created earlier.

We have a set of migrations_ included. Migrations_ are python scripts that create all the tables, relations, contraints, etc needed to run the system. To save time, we will just restore the demo data provided in this repo. The demo data is an empty mysql database archive that is exactly what you would get if you ran the ``migrate`` command.

Restore the demo data

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/clinicedc/meta3-demo/demo_data && \
    tar xzf meta3_demo.sql.tar.gz && \
    mysql meta3_demo < meta3_demo.sql && \
    cd ~/clinicedc/meta3-demo/

Note
    There are a few caveats to migrating your own database instead of using the demo data. Running ``migrate`` on an empty database takes more than 30 min. Also, you will run into a few simple problems with the `data` migrations. See the note on`running migrations on an empty database` in `Troubleshooting`_ below.

Now that our database has the required data schema, we need to run the post-migrate signals_ to populate some static data. But this does not take long. 

To do this, run the ``migrate`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    # run migrate to trigger the post-migrate signals
    python manage.py migrate


Next, import the list of ``holidays`` to be used when scheduling appointments.

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py import_holidays

Next, create a user. Do this from the command line using the createsuperuser_ command.

.. code-block:: bash

  python manage.py createsuperuser

Important
    The new user you just created is a ``superuser``. Once logged in you will remove the superuser status for
    this account.

Now start up the test server using the runserver_ command

.. code-block:: bash

  python manage.py runserver


Open your browser and point it to

.. code-block:: bash

  localhost:8000

You should see the login screen for the META3_ trial running at `Temeke Hospital`_ in Tanzania.

Type in the credentials of the ``superuser`` account you created above.

Now that you are logged in, let's make some necessary changes to your account.

Go to your user account. You can use the user name link at the top right corner of the page.

Follow these steps to configure a working account with rights to create new users and rights to add, update and delete clinical data.

* Under the section **Personal Details**, fill in your name and email.
* Under the section **Permissions**, uncheck *Superuser status*.
* In the middle of section **User Profile** you will see `Sites`. Add yourself to the following site:

    * temeke.tz.meta3.clinicedc.org

* At the bottom of section **User Profile** you will see `Roles`. Add yourself to the following roles:

    * Account Manager
    * Staff
    * Clinician Super

* Click SAVE at the bottom of the form 

Now you are ready to screen your first participant!

Click ``Home`` on the breadcrumbs at the left on the top bar to get started.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Running migrate on an empty database
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you run `migrate` on an empty database, a few of the `data` migrations might fail.
Since these failed migrations are `data` migrations and not `schema` migrations, it is safe to run migrate until it fails,
fake the failed `data` migration, and continue.

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py migrate

    # fake the data migration
    python manage.py migrate meta_prn 0035 --fake

    # restart migrate
    python manage.py migrate

    # fake the data migration
    python manage.py migrate meta_subject 0107 --fake

    # restart migrate
    python manage.py migrate

    # fake the data migration
    python manage.py migrate meta_subject 0132 --fake

    # restart migrate
    python manage.py migrate

Removing the demo when you are done
-----------------------------------

drop the database::

  mysql -Bse "drop database meta3_demo;"

deactivate the conda environment::

  conda deactivate

remove the conda environment::

  conda env remove -n meta3_demo

Finally, delete the `clinicedc` folder.
